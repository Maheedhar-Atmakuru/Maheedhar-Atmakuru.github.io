# Individual Project 1 - Portfolio Website Development 

## Overview

In Project-1, I created a portfolio website that features my personal details and includes my resume. The project incorporates concepts learned during labs and hackathons. Additionally, I integrated a REST API to display weather information and employed CSS and external JavaScript to enhance various functionalities. I also implemented cookies to store client information and customize interactions based on that data. The technologies used in this project include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ajax for making asynchronous API calls without reloading the page.

I have uploaded the code in my private repository [https://github.com/Maheedhar-Atmakuru/Maheedhar-Atmakuru.github.io] (https://github.com/Maheedhar-Atmakuru/Maheedhar-Atmakuru.github.io)

## Introduction

For this project, I was tasked with creating a personal website hosted on GitHub Pages. Following my lecturer's guidance, I set out to complete this assignment.
Repository Creation and Cloning
The first step was to create a GitHub repository with the specific name "github.io." This is a requirement for hosting a personal website on GitHub Pages. After creating the repository, I made it public, allowing the public to access my website. I then cloned the repository to my local workspace, ready to begin adding content.
Adding Content
Based on the instructions from a previous video lecture, I created an "waph.html" file in the repository. This allowed me to add more content and features to my website, beyond the basic structure.

## Incorporating Bootstrap

My lecturer recommended using Bootstrap for this project, so I searched for and customized a free Bootstrap theme to fit my needs. I downloaded the Bootstrap files and included them in my HTML code, allowing me to leverage the framework's styling and functionality.
Enhancing the Website
To further improve my website, I included my resume in PDF format, organizing it using various divs and subpages. I also utilized CSS to style the forms and display images in frames.

## Integrating JavaScript Features

To make my website more interactive and engaging, I added several JavaScript-powered features. These include digital and analog clocks, as well as email functionality, building on my previous work in Lab 2.

## Leveraging APIs

I incorporated two APIs into my "index.html" file: the JokesAPI and the Weatherbit API. The JokesAPI displays a new joke every minute, while the Weatherbit API provides updates on the local weather. The Weatherbit API requires a unique API key, which I added to my code, while the JokesAPI does not require an API key.
Additionally, I added a free flag counter to the "index.html" file, which displays a new country flag.

The main purpose of the website's cookie management is to inform users that they have previously visited the page at a certain time. Initially, the website displays a welcome message when a user visits for the first time. On subsequent visits, it shows a "welcome back" message along with the timestamp of their last visit. To enhance user experience, the cookies are set to expire after 30 days.

Additionally, I have integrated a random luck generator using JavaScript that produces a random lucky number. From Lab 2, I also incorporated significant code for both the digital and analog clocks.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I have successfully created a personal website hosted on GitHub Pages. By following my lecturer's guidance, I have incorporated various features and technologies, including Bootstrap, JavaScript, and APIs, to enhance the user experience and functionality of my website.
